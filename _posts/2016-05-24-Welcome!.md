Welcome to My New Blog!

Your probably wondering who I am. Well, currently I am a Student working at an internship, doing all kinds of things. My main passions lie in Linux, Containers, Networking, and Scripting. Ideally, I would love to work as a Sysadmin or somewhere in the Dev Ops ecosystem. As of writing this I am studying for the RHCSA Exam. I am planning on taking this test sometime in the summer around my 18th birthday. I plan on updating this blog with all my crazy adventures in Linux and Programming. Please stayed tuned in!
